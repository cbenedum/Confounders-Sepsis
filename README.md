Study 3: Comparing Traditional and Algorithmic Based Approaches for Covariate Selection: A Methodological Application to Estimating the Effect of Autoimmune Diseases on 30-Day Mortality Among ICU Patients with Sepsis.

Goals: This study evaluates how traditional and algorithmic absed approaches differ in selecting confounders. This study uses expert knowledge (traditional) and causal discovery algorithms to identify variables for inclusion in the final model.
  1) How many and which variables did each approach propose for statistical adjustment
  2) How did differences in the proposed sets of variables impact effect estimates and model precision
